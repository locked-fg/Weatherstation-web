Weatherstation-Frontend
=======================

This repository holds the HTML5 frontend for the [weatherstation project](https://github.com/locked-fg/Weatherstation).
The Weatherstaation project itself connects to sensors, aggregates the data and sends it to the webserver serving this project.

Different measures can be toggled via cursor right/left or when clicking / typing on the righ/left hand side of the upper section of the page.
Swipe actions would be great as well but I didn't get jquery swipe actions to work in reasonable time, so I just leave it as is.

You can see the project in action on [wetter.Locked.de](http://wetter.Locked.de).
